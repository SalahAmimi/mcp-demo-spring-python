## 📝 Project Description

This project is a distributed frontend-backend architecture focused on AI integration. It consists of the following main components:

- 🎨 **Frontend**: A modern user interface built with **Angular**.
- ☕ **Java Backend**:
  - A **server module** developed using **Spring Boot** and **Spring AI**, acting as the main AI agent.
  - A **Spring AI client** that communicates with other services to execute available tools.
- 🐍 **Python Server**: Hosts additional AI tools accessible via an API.
- 🗃️ **File System Integration**: Implements tool discovery using **Node.js** scripts to simulate and interact with remote file systems.
- 🤖 **AI Agent Behavior**: The agent dynamically discovers and utilizes tools exposed by both Java and Python servers.
- 🔗 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Ensures seamless communication and context-sharing between components, enabling consistent and intelligent AI-driven responses.

This setup provides a **modular, multi-language, and extensible AI framework**, enabling smooth integration of intelligent tools across distributed services.
